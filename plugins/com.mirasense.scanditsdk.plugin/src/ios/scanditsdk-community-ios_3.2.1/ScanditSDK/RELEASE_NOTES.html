<h1>What's New in Scandit SDK 3.2.* for iOS</h1>

<p>If you are still using Scandit SDK 2.2.* or 3.0.*, we strongly recommend that 
you upgrade as soon as possible to benefit from the better autofocus control for iOS7 devices in 3.1.* and 3.2.*.  </p>

<p>Scandit SDK 3.2.* features a number of improvements to the overall scanning 
performance and a few bug fixes (see details below):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Better PDF417 decoding (no longer in beta): We implemented a more sophisticated PDf417 decoder that is capable of 
decoding PDF417 barcodes with tiny features such as those PDF417 codes found on US driving licenses. (The PDF417 decoder is 
disabled by default).</p></li>
<li><p>Better ITF/Code39/Code128/QR decoding: We improved the decoding performance of these decoders to have better
dynamic range. </p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Compatibility Concerns</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>PDF417 decoding is now disabled by default. In previous versions of the ScanditSDK, PDF417 decoding was 
enabled by default. Since our new PDF417 decoding algorithm provides significantly better scan performance, but also 
requires more resources, it is switched off by default. </p></li>
<li><p>In iOS7, the camera preview is no longer added below the status bar or navigation bar
but the two ui elements are overlays. If you are restricting the area where barcodes are scanned via 
the restrictActiveScanningArea and you are adding your own custom overlay to instruct the user where to align
the barcode, you will need to take care that the active scanning area of the Scandit SDK decoder 
(controlled via the hotspot) is aligned with the target area suggested by your overlay.  </p></li>
<li><p>Scandit SDK 3.* requires a new iOS framework: libc++. To add the library, select your 
target in Xcode, choose build phases and add the library under the "Link Binary With Libraries" entry.</p></li>
<li><p>In 3.0+, we only support iOS devices with iOS 5.0 and higher. If you need need iOS 4.3 support, 
using Scandit SDK 2.0+ for iOS. </p></li>
<li><p>In 3.0+, we no longer support the iPhone 3G. If you need iPhone 3G support, we recommend 
using Scandit SDK 2.0+ for iOS. </p></li>
<li><p>Access to the methods that are available for scan screen customization has been 
restricted for users of our free Community edition. They remain available for our 
enterprise customers. Moving forward we want apps using our free community 
edition to have a common scan screen user interface that promotes our Scandit brand. </p></li>
<li><p>The Scandit SDK starts by default in full screen scanning mode. If you want to only scan barcodes 
in a restricted area of the camera image, you should call the "restrictActiveScanningArea" method of 
the ScanditSDKBarcodePicker.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Bug fixes in 3.2.1 (November, 22th 2013)</h2>

<ul>
<li>Fixed issue that led to app crash whenever picker was presented as view controller (and
not as subview) under iOS7.0.* and in combination with a certain state of the view hierarchy. In our test setup, we could reproduce this crash only when a MKMapView was present in the view hierarchy (other view configurations might possibly also cause this crash though). </li>
</ul>

<h2>Bug fixes in 3.2.0 (November, 1st 2013)</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Fixed issue that caused unwanted, duplicate scans when scanning multiple barcodes sequentially on latest 
generation iOS devices </p></li>
<li><p>Fixed issue that caused barcode highlighting to be slightly off on some iOS devices. </p></li>
<li><p>Fixed bug where QR codes with large module size covering the entire screen were not decoded. </p></li>
<li><p>Software update of demo apps to use automatic reference counting. </p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Known Issues (will be fixed in one of the next releases):</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>The micro datamatrix mode shows worse performance in this 3.2.0 release than in the previous 3.1.0 release. We are currently looking into 
the cause and will fix this in the next bug fix release. </p></li>
<li><p>On iOS7 devices, the autofocus is configured to only focus on objects close to the camera. We will offer a new feature in the next release
to disable this macro mode for scenarios where (large) 1D and 2D codes need to be scanned from further away. </p></li>
</ul>

<h2>New Features in 3.1.0</h2>

<p>Scandit SDK 3.1.* features a number of improvements to the overall scanning 
performance. We recommend that you upgrade as soon as possible to take advantage of the better 
scan performance - in particular because of the better autofocus control with iOS7. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Better Autofocus Control: Scandit SDK 3.1 takes advantage of the APIs in iOS7 that 
allow for better control of the autofocus. </p></li>
<li><p>Better Blurry Barcode Localization: In 3.0, we introduced full screen barcode detection
and decoding, but blurry barcodes were not always reliable detected when off-center. Scandit SDK 3.1
provides a novel barcode localization algorithm that also detects blurry barcodes. </p></li>
<li><p>Better Blurry Decoding: In Scandit SDK 3.1, we improved the scan performance with fixed focus cameras, e.g. the iPad3' front-facing camera. </p></li>
<li><p>New Demo Apps: We replaced the old demo app with two new demo apps. The first demo app only shows the
minimal steps necessary to run the Scandit SDK. The second new demo app has a new view that lists
all the settings of the Scandit API. Developers can now experiment with the different features in the app before 
they use them themselves in their own apps. </p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Bug fixes in 3.1.1 (September, 27th 2013)</h2>

<ul>
<li>Bug fix to address problem in 3.1.0 where setOverlayController method of ScanditSDKBarcodePicker was not working. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Bug fixes in 3.1.0 (September, 26th 2013)</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Software update to the search bar implementation. Under iOS7, it is no longer possible to dynamically change the caption 
of the search bar (from "Cancel" -> "Go"). We added a "Search" button to the keyboard. The language of the "Cancel" button caption is 
now automatically updated based on the language set by the user. </p></li>
<li><p>Fixed bug where barcodes where not always correctly highlighted in the scan user interface. </p></li>
<li><p>Fixed bug where didScanBarcode was occasionally called twice. </p></li>
<li><p>Increased frame rate for iPhone devices such as the iPhone 5, 4 and 4S. In previous bug fix release 3.0.4 we reduced the frame rate to prevent distortion issue on iPads. This reduction led to a sluggish user interface on devices such as the iPhone4. </p></li>
</ul>

<h2>New Features in 3.0.0</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>full screen scanning: In Scandit SDK 2.*, the user had to place the barcode in the
 center of the camera image. In this new release, barcodes are detected and decoded in
 the entire camera image.</p></li>
<li><p>improved autofocus management: We improved the camera control which means that the
 camera properties (such as focus) are maintained over successive barcode scans. This new
 feature makes a big difference if you are planning on scanning multiple barcodes in 
 sequence.</p></li>
<li><p>better scan performance and robustness: We further improved our blurry barcode decoding 
 algorithms so that even the very blurry images of an iPhone 5 (before the autofocus is 
 activated) are now decoded. </p></li>
<li><p>new cleaner scan screen interface with the option to add a button to switch cameras 
 (from the front to the back camera) </p></li>
<li><p>new symbologies: beta support for PDF417 and MSI Plessey. </p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Bug fixes in 3.0.4 (August 2nd, 2013) </h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Fixed issue where rapid allocation and deallocation of ScanditSDKBarcodePicker could lead to app crash for 
some view controller configurations. </p></li>
<li><p>Fixed issue in new full image barcode detection algorithm that could lead to rare app crashes when camera image 
featured particular repetitive texture. </p></li>
<li><p>Enabled camera switch for tablets in Scandit SDK demo app.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Bug fixes in 3.0.3 (July 17th, 2013 - available as enterprise trial only)</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Fixed issue where camera image was slightly distorted on iPad devices. </p></li>
<li><p>Fixed issue where previously set1DEnabled would not enable MSIPlessey Decoder and set2DEnabled would 
not enable PDF417 decoder. </p></li>
<li><p>Software update to decode blurry barcodes that upside down in the camera image.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed issue where barcode highlighting in camera image was slightly off on some iOS devices. </p></li>
<li><p>Fixed issue where orientation changes would freeze camera when the scanning area was restricted via the 
"restrictActiveScanningArea" method.</p></li>
<li><p>Software update to switch off the "StandBy" state introduced in 3.0.0. The Scandit SDK enters this 
StandBy state by default after a successful scan because it makes subsequent scanner starts 
significantly faster. This "StandBy" State requires additional resources (power, memory) though and 
can be disabled by calling disableStandbyState on the picker. </p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Bug fixes in 3.0.2: </h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Fixed a bug in the memory management of the ScanditSDKBarcodePicker where the release of the 
picker object could interfere with the instantiation of a new picker object. This could have been 
the cause of problems with ARC in 3.0.0 and 3.0.1.  </p></li>
<li><p>Fixed a bug where the reset of the viewfinder and the viewfinder animation was not 
working correctly. </p></li>
<li><p>Fixed a bug in implementation of ScanditSDKNextFrameDelegate protocol that was not working 
since the 3.0.0 update. </p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Bug fixes in 3.0.1:</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Updated ScanditSDKRotatingBarcodePicker to also access iphone settings if ipad ones arent available when 
retrieving supportedInterfaceOrientations.</p></li>
<li><p>Removed duplicate header entry that caused warning message in Xcode.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed bug where white viewfinder rectangle in the scan UI was jumping between different barcode locations 
when barcode is in vertical orientation. </p></li>
<li><p>Fixed bug where white viewfinder rectangle changed size when presented as navigation controller and the user 
changed orientation from portrait to landscape and back to portrait. </p></li>
<li><p>Fixed a bug which did not allow the picker to be locked into a non-portrait orientation.</p></li>
<li><p>Added a method to maintain the torch state in between successful scans. The current default implementation
of stopScanning switches the torch off. The new method is called stopScanningAndKeepTorchState. </p></li>
<li><p>Fixed a small bug in the torch implementation. Previously, the user had to tap the icon twice after a previous "stop torch" command. </p></li>
<li><p>Fixed a viewfinder resizing issue when an iPhone is turned from portrait to landscape back to portrait. </p></li>
<li><p>Fixed a bug where the cancel button would not respond on iPads in landscape mode when the ScanditSDKBarcodePicker was presented modally.</p></li>
</ul>
