/**
 * Starts the scanning. You call this the following way from java script (success and failure are
 * callback functions defined by you):
 *
 * cordova.exec(success, failure, "ScanditSDK", "scan", ["___your_app_key___",
 *              {"option1":"value1", "option2":true}]);
 *
 *
 * The available options are:
 *
 * exampleStringForOption: defaultValue
 * Short explanation of option.
 *
 * preferFrontCamera: false
 * Whether showing the front camera should be preferred over the back camera (for devices without a
 * front camera the back camera is shown).
 *
 * orientation: (default setting is the same as set in the app settings)
 * Sets which orientations are allowed for the scanner if they should differ from the orientations
 * that are allowed in the whole app. Legal values: portrait, portraitUpsideDown, landscapeLeft,
 * landscapeRight. Example: "landscapeRight,landscapeLeft"
 *
 * disableStandbyState: false
 * Disables the standby state of the camera between times when the scanner is actually running.
 * If your app accesses the camera in multiple ways it is recommended to set this to true.
 *
 * searchBar: true
 * Shows or hides the search bar at the top of the screen.
 *
 * 1DScanning: true
 * Enables or disables the recognition of 1D codes.
 *
 * 2DScanning: true
 * Enables or disables the recognition of 2D codes.
 *
 * ean13AndUpc12: true
 * Enables or disables the recognition of EAN13 and UPC12/UPCA codes.
 *
 * ean8: true
 * Enables or disables the recognition of EAN8 codes.
 *
 * upce: true
 * Enables or disables the recognition of UPCE codes.
 *
 * code39: true
 * Enables or disables the recognition of CODE39 codes.
 * Note: Not all Scandit SDK versions support Code 39 scanning.
 *
 * code128: true
 * Enables or disables the recognition of CODE128 codes.
 * Note: Not all Scandit SDK versions support Code 128 scanning.
 *
 * itf: true
 * Enables or disables the recognition of ITF codes.
 * Note: Not all Scandit SDK versions support ITF scanning.
 *
 * qr: true
 * Enables or disables the recognition of QR codes.
 *
 * dataMatrix: true
 * Enables or disables the recognition of Data Matrix codes.
 * Note: Not all Scandit SDK versions support Data Matrix scanning.
 *
 * pdf417: true
 * Enables or disables the recognition of PDF417 codes.
 * Note: Not all Scandit SDK versions support PDF417 scanning.
 *
 * msiPlessey: false
 * Enables or disables the recognition of MSI Plessey codes.
 * Note: Not all Scandit SDK versions support MSI Plessey scanning.
 *
 * msiPlesseyChecksumType: "mod10"
 * Sets the type of checksum that is expected of the MSI Plessey codes.
 * Legal values are: "none", "mod10", "mod11", "mod1010", "mod1110"
 *
 * inverseRecognition: false
 * Enables the detection of white on black codes. This option currently
 * only works on Data Matrix codes.
 *
 * microDataMatrix: false
 * Enables special settings to allow the recognition of very small Data
 * Matrix codes. If this is not specifically needed, do not enable it as it
 * uses considerable processing power. This setting automatically forces
 * 2d recognition on every frame. This option only works on devices with
 * Android 2.2 or higher, it does not cause issues with lower versions but
 * simply doesn't work.
 *
 * restrictActiveScanningArea: false
 * Reduces the area in which barcodes are detected and decoded to an
 * area defined by setScanningHotSpotHeight and setScanningHotSpotToX andY.
 * If this method is set to disabled, barcodes in the full camera image
 * are detected and decoded.
 *
 * force2d: false
 * Forces the engine to always run a 2d recognition, ignoring whether a 2d
 * code was detected in the current frame.
 *
 * scanningHotSpot: "0.5/0.5" (x/y)
 * Changes the location of the spot where the recognition actively scans for
 * barcodes. X and y can be between 0 and 1, where 0/0 is the top left corner
 * and 1/1 the bottom right corner.
 *
 * scanningHotSpotHeight: 0.25
 * Changes the height of the spot where the recognition actively scans for
 * barcodes. The height of the hot spot is given relative to the height of
 * the screen and has to be between 0.0 and 0.5.
 * Be aware that if the hot spot height is very large, the engine is forced
 * to decrease the quality of the recognition to keep the speed at an
 * acceptable level.
 *
 * viewfinderSize: "0.8/0.4/0.6/0.4" (width/height/landscapeWidth/landscapeHeight)
 * Sets the size of the viewfinder relative to the size of the screen size.
 * Changing this value does not(!) affect the area in which barcodes are successfully recognized.
 * It only changes the size of the box drawn onto the scan screen.
 *
 * ignorePreviewAspectRatio: false
 * Normally the picker adjusts to the aspect ratio of the preview image. If
 * this is called, it will no longer do this.
 * Warning: If the aspect ratio is not kept, the camera feed may be
 * stretched and no longer be a proper representation of what is recorded.
 *
 * beep: true
 * Enables or disables the sound played when a code was recognized.
 *
 * vibrate: true
 * Enables or disables the vibration when a code was recognized.
 *
 * torch: true
 * Enables or disables the torch toggle button for all devices that support a torch.
 *
 * torchButtonPositionAndSize: "0.05/0.01/67/33" (x/y/width/height)
 * Sets the position at which the button to enable the torch is drawn. The X and Y coordinates are
 * relative to the screen size, which means they have to be between 0 and 1.
 *
 * cameraSwitchVisibility: "never"
 * Sets when the camera switch button is visible for all devices that have more than one camera.
 * Legal values are: "never", "tablet", "always"
 *
 * cameraSwitchButtonPositionAndSize: "0.05/0.01/67/33" (x/y/width/height)
 * Sets the position at which the button to switch the camera is drawn. The X and Y coordinates are
 * relative to the screen size, which means they have to be between 0 and 1. Be aware that the x
 * coordinate is calculated from the right side of the screen and not the left like with the torch
 * button.
 *
 * logoOffsets: "0, 0, 0, 0" (xOffset, yOffset, landscapeXOffset, landscapeYOffset)
 * Sets the x and y offset at which the Scandit logo should be drawn for both portrait and landscape
 * orientation. Be aware that the standard Scandit SDK licenses do not allow you to hide the logo.
 *
 * searchBarActionButtonCaption: "Go"
 * Sets the caption of the manual entry at the top when a barcode of valid length has been entered.
 *
 * searchBarCancelButtonCaption: "Cancel"
 * Sets the caption of the manual entry at the top when no barcode of valid length has been entered.
 *
 * searchBarPlaceholderText: "Scan barcode or enter it here"
 * Sets the text shown in the manual entry field when nothing has been entered yet.
 *
 * toolBarButtonCaption: "Cancel"
 * Sets the caption of the toolbar button.
 *
 * viewfinderColor: "FFFFFF"
 * Sets the color of the static viewfinder and while tracking before the code has been recognized.
 *
 * viewfinderDecodedColor: "00FF00"
 * Sets the color of the viewfinder when the code has been recognized.
 *
 * minSearchBarBarcodeLength: 8
 * Sets the minimum size a barcode in the manual entry field has to have to possibly be valid.
 *
 * maxSearchBarBarcodeLength: 100
 * Sets the maximum size a barcode in the manual entry field can have to possibly be valid.
